# 📍 Indoor Navigation Web App (Python)

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Indoor Navigation Web Application** is a mini project developed using Python to help users navigate inside buildings using a map-based interface. Since GPS is not effective indoors, this application allows users to select locations on a building map and find the shortest path between them.

This project is fully web-based and designed for environments such as colleges, offices, hospitals, and malls where users need assistance locating rooms, labs, or departments.
